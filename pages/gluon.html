<p>About: A new community is born for students who want to offer scholastic help.
    Through geolocation you will be able to browse your country and look for the best student or
    teacher near you who can improve your school mark or prepare for exam,
    if you want you will be the one who will help a student in difficulty.
    It will handle all the application, a calendar will show the availability of tutors,
    you just have to do a click and that exam will become a joke.
    All this will be verified by a feedback system in order to obtain the most transparent
    service possible.</p>
