        <p>The idea is an ios app with a wheel that you spin.
            Whatever the wheel lands on is the suggested restaurant or type of food you should eat.
        </p>
        <p>The purpose is to make food decisions easier and pull people out of their comfort zones.
            We're also trying to educate non-foodies in the culinary world around them,
            or simply save many future disputes between couples that can't agree on what to eat lol.
